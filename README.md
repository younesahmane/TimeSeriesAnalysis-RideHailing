# TimeSeriesAnalysis-RideHailing

## Overview
The goal of this project is to analyze **hourly Uber pickup data from the Bronx** using time-series techniques to model and forecast ride demand.  
Unlike previous studies that included multiple boroughs, this analysis focuses solely on the Bronx, enabling a more detailed examination of local ride-hailing dynamics.
